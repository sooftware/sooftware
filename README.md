I would like to introduce myself as an artificial intelligence research engineer rather than a research scientist. My dream is to make artificial intelligence like Jarvis in the movie Iron Man - so I am very interested in deep learning techniques such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, and open-domain dialogue. Recently I began a startup with 5 co-founding members - all of them were my teammates at Kakao Brain. We named our startup **TUNiB**. We are looking for talented colleagues to work with. You can check more information on our [website](http://www.tunib.ai/). If you are interested, please don't hesitate to contact me. (kaki.ai@tunib.ai)
