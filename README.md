### About Me
  
Hi! My name is Soohwan Kim and I live in South Korea. My github ID sooftware is a combination of Soohwan and software. I am an artificial intelligence engineer who dreams of making artificial intelligence like a human. I have expertise in speech and natural language processing among artificial intelligence fields. And I'm very supportive of open source culture. So I made some open sources hoping to help others. Currently, I am working at [TUNiB](http://www.tunib.ai/).
  
### My Activities
    
#### NLP open-source projects
- [pororo](https://github.com/kakaobrain/pororo) - A library that can solve more than 30 natural language processing tasks in just 3-4 lines with pre-trained models.
- [nlp-paper-reading](https://github.com/kakaobrain/nlp-paper-reading) - The nlp paper reading study I did when I was in Kakao Brain.  
- [attentions](https://github.com/sooftware/attentions) - A project is a collection of attention mechanisms that I implemented while studying attention.
  
#### Speech open-source projects
- [OpenSpeech](https://github.com/sooftware/OpenSpeech) - A framework that enables easy creation of speech recognition models of various models and various languages.
- [KoSpeech](https://github.com/sooftware/KoSpeech) - A framework for making speech recognizers specialized in Korean easily.
- [conformer](https://github.com/sooftware/conformer) - A project that implements a speech recognition model named Conformer.  
- [tacotron2](https://github.com/sooftware/tacotron2) - A project to implement speech synthesis model named tacotron2.
- [KsponSpeech](https://github.com/sooftware/ksponspeech) - A project that preprocess speech datasets called KsponSpeech in various ways.
- [speech-paper-reading](https://github.com/speech-paper-reading/speech-paper-reading) - The speech processing paper reading study.
  
#### Misc
- [pytorch-lr-scheduler](https://github.com/sooftware/pytorch-lr-scheduler) - A project that has been released by gathering lr schedulers that I often use.
