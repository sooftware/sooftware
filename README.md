## Welcome <img src="https://h5p.org/sites/default/files/h5p/content/295752/images/file-5b73018c5fa4b.gif" width="30px">   

Current Co-founder & AI Research Engineer of TUNiB Inc. Previously at Kakao Brain. I majored in Electronic & Communication Engineering and minored in Data Science at Kwangwoon University. I am a AI research engineer rather than a research scientist. My dream is to make Jarvis in the movie Iron Man. So I am very interested in deep learning techniques such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, and open domain dialogue. I'm looking for talented colleagues to work with at TUNiB. If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact me! (kaki.ai@tunib.ai)
