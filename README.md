## Welcome <img src="https://h5p.org/sites/default/files/h5p/content/295752/images/file-5b73018c5fa4b.gif" width="30px">   

Current Co-founder & AI Research Engineer of TUNiB Inc. Previously at Kakao Brain. I majored in Electronic & Communication Engineering and minored in Data Science at Kwangwoon university. I hope to be a research engineer rather than a research scientist. My research interests include technologies for human-machine interaction, such as automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, and natural language processing. I enjoy software development and sometimes like to write my knowledge or thoughts at my blog. I root for open-source culture, and I want to contribute. You can check my github page to see what I am currently up to.
