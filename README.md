### About Me
  
Hi! My name is Soohwan Kim and I live in South Korea. My github ID `sooftware` is a combination of `Soohwan` and `software`. I am an artificial intelligence engineer dreaming to make human-like artificial intelligence. I have expertise in speech and natural language processing among artificial intelligence fields. As I support the open-source philosophy, I made some open-sources hoping to help others. Currently, I am working at [TUNiB](http://www.tunib.ai/).
  
### My Activities
    
#### NLP open-source projects
- [pororo](https://github.com/kakaobrain/pororo) - Library that can solve more than 30 natural language processing tasks in just 3-4 lines with pre-trained models.
- [attentions](https://github.com/sooftware/attentions) - Collection of attention mechanisms that I implemented while studying attention.
- [transformer](https://github.com/sooftware/transformer) - Pytorch implementation of "Attention Is All You Need".
  
  
#### Speech open-source projects
- [OpenSpeech](https://github.com/sooftware/OpenSpeech) - Framework that enables easy creation of speech recognition models of various models and various languages.
- [KoSpeech](https://github.com/sooftware/KoSpeech) - Framework for making speech recognizers specialized in Korean easily.
- [conformer](https://github.com/sooftware/conformer) - Pytorch implementation of "Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition".  
- [tacotron2](https://github.com/sooftware/tacotron2) - Pytorch implementation of "Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning WaveNet on Mel Spectrogram Predictions".
- [KsponSpeech](https://github.com/sooftware/ksponspeech) - Project that preprocess speech datasets called KsponSpeech in various ways.
- [Fairseq-Listen-Attend-Spell](https://github.com/sooftware/Fairseq-Listen-Attend-Spell) - Implementation of "Listen, Attend and Spell" using Fairseq.
- [Speech-Transformer](https://github.com/sooftware/speech-transformer) - Pytorch implementation of "Speech-Transformer: A No-Recurrence Seq2seq Model for Speech Recognition"
  
#### Misc
- [pytorch-lr-scheduler](https://github.com/sooftware/pytorch-lr-scheduler) - Collection of lr schedulers that I often use.
- [nlp-paper-reading](https://github.com/kakaobrain/nlp-paper-reading) - NLP paper reading study I did when I was in Kakao Brain.  
- [speech-paper-reading](https://github.com/speech-paper-reading/speech-paper-reading) - Speech processing paper reading study.
